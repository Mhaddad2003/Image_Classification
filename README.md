# Wild Animals Image Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying wild animal images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the ResNet101 architecture. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of wild animals into predefined categories. The CNN model is built using the ResNet101 architecture, fine-tuned for this classification task.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes image data augmentation and preprocessing techniques.
- **Model Training**: Implements a ResNet101-based model with transfer learning.
- **Evaluation**: Includes confusion matrix plots to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Saving**: The final trained model is saved for future use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for model implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Frameworks for building and training CNN models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for plotting and visualizing data.
- **NumPy & Scikit-Learn**: Libraries for numerical operations and metrics.

## Installation and Setup
